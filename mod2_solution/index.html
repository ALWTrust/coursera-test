 <h1>Our Menu</h1>

  <div class="section">
  	<h2 class="dog">Hot Dog</h2>
  	<p>A solid roller with artificial casing. Lots of mustard, but absolutely no bun. Banned in several nations. Not recommended for children, the elderly, or anyone with a mitochondrial disorder. It should be removed from the menu entirely and yet it demands to be served. May God forgive us.</p>

   <div class="section">
 	<h2 class="beef">Burger</h2>
 	<p>A large slab of what we assume to have been a cow or comparable bovine-like animal. Lots of grease and almost no bone. Flame charred to perfection with a special dipping sauce we found in the parking lot. Rated top burger by Toothless Pete. Keeping the rock-and-roll spirit alive.</p>

   <div class="section">
 	<h2 class="chicken">Nugget</h2>
 	<p>A gift and a curse. Gaze at its lack of geometric coherence. A complete mystery and perhaps the secret that can save us all. Hints of saw dust and bird meat. Have it thrown into your mouth directly by our trained staff. Don't fear the treasure and it may reveal its wonders.</p>
